📌 Project Overview

TaskFlow is a full-stack web application developed to help users manage their daily tasks in an efficient and organized way. The application allows users to add, view, and delete tasks with real-time updates, providing a smooth single-page application experience.

The frontend is built using React with Vite, which ensures fast loading and a responsive user interface. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, making the application clean, modern, and mobile-friendly.

The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, exposing RESTful APIs that handle all task-related operations. MongoDB is used as the database to store tasks securely and persistently.

This project is designed to demonstrate practical implementation of MERN stack concepts such as client-server communication, REST APIs, CRUD operations, and modern frontend development practices.
